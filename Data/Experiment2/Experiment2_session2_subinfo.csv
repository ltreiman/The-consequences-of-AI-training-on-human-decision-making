In practical terms, though, I'm not sure you necessarily could come up with a universally optimal strategy, because you'd have to account for the utility your opponents' gain (or at least don't lose) from not feeling cheated when they reject an offer that they feel is unfair, and the exact value of that reletive to the value of any potential money they might receive is hard to put a attach a simple number to and in any case varies wildly from person to person and all that. That being said, though, I was playing this more under the mindset that us Prolific participants need to work to ensure that fairness is maintained in these games so that everyone benefits, e.g., by doing stuff like punishing players who don't contribute in the public goods game whenever we have a chance to do that, and so in this case that would include rejecting offers that are just blatantly unfair."
