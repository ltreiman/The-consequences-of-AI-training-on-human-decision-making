I could have driven the bargain all the way up to $10, but I didn't because it wasn't clear a) whether that would even come up as an option; b) how the ""AI"" was being trained or whether it was already trained on other participants' responses at all  â€“ i.e., would it be rewarded based on the amount *it* earned, or just based on how well it imitated my play? and would others' play be inputs to the training data too, or just me? (scare quotes because it's probably just a linear regression or a really simple RL agent if it's even real). In fact, I ended up lowering my threshold about halfway through to just any offer weighted toward me, since I never saw any bids higher than 4-6.  Also, my earnings from this part of the study played some part, and there's a big uncertainty dropoff regarding whether I'll actually play the second half of the study (maybe I'll be busy and won't get around to it, maybe Prolific won't show me the second half of the study, as has happened in other cases before), so I'm taking like a quarter of the marshmallow now. I didn't bother looking at whether the opponent was another human or an AI, since in studies like this they usually lie about that anyway.","Question not asked","Question not asked"
