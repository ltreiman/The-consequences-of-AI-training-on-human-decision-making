My strategy this time was, something is better than nothing, which is what I got last time, but seriously, how did I know I would get screwed?  Because in these games I alway, ALWAYS get zero or the lowest possible amount.Go figure...","no","The house wins.  This is why I never gamble except in games like this where I have not put any of my money in,and where I know you will give me as little money as possible.  Random draw indeed!"

I think previously I felt some kind of bias against the AI, as if I had to decline unfair offers it was making, but I realized that I just lose out in the end by doing that. Mutual cooperation by accepting all offers helps not only myself but both the Prolific and AI participants. Everyone wins. There's no real downside other than the ego blast of knowing that you're getting less of the pie, but when *nothing* is what you get in the end for sticking to your guns, it's not even worth it. I'll gladly humble myself to accept all offers in this game.","No.","Probably mutual cooperation. Is this like the Prisoner's Dilemma?"
