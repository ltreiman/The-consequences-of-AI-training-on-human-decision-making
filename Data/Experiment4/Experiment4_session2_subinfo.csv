So I just treated the AI the same as the human partner. I accepted anything I thought was fair. Anything giving me at least $5 was fair. I also accepted $4 because I figured I could have gotten a greedy or immature partner as a human or just a glitch in the AI programming. I figured $4 is reasonable for having an immature human partner or an AI glitch. Anything less than $3 for me signals a fault in the AI training, so I rejected it in the hopes the programmers would fix the glitch. With the human, I felt the human was being greedy, and it was worth it to me to miss out the bonus money in order not to enable the greediness in the human.","no",NA
